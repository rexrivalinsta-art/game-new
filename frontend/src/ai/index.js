 * AI — enemy characters, navigation, perception, cover selection and combat

 * WHAT LIVES WHERE
 *   rig.js        25-bone skeleton, bind pose, weapon anchor points
 *   geo.js        loft/tube/revolve toolkit, skin binder, baked vertex AO
 *   parts.js      body and kit: jacket, plate carrier, pouches, helmet, boots
 *   weapon.js     the carried carbine / long rifle, baked into the character
 *   livery.js     the neon player-colour palette + the flat untextured materials
 *   soldier.js    variant assembly -> one skinned geometry + material list
 *   clips.js      hand-authored pose layers (idle/walk/run/crouch/hit/recoil…)
 *   animator.js   layered blending + aim, look-at, arm and foot IK
 *   nav.js        walkability grid from the physics BVH, A*, string pulling,
 *                 cover point extraction and scoring
 *   agent.js      one enemy: senses, state machine, gun, hit zones, death
 *   squad.js      peek rotation, contact sharing, flank and grenade rationing
 *   roo.js        the map critter (Shivam's kangaroo): harmless until a player
 *                 shoots it, detonates, respawned by the lit pad ritual
 *
 * PUBLIC API — `const ai = ctx.get('ai')`
 *   ai.spawn(variant, position, yaw, opts) -> Agent   (opts.livery = colour slot)
 *   ai.takeLivery() / ai.releaseLivery(slot)  bot colour slots, never a player's
 *   ai.materialsFor(variant, slot)         the material array for one livery
 *   ai.populate({squads, perSquad, respawn}) garrison the level through the
 *                                          world's spawn director
 *   ai.reinforce(n)                        bring n replacements in now
 *   ai.clearGarrison()                     retire every bot and stop reinforcing

 *   ai.getHudActors()                      minimap blips — empty unless a recon

 *
 * FRAME BUDGETS — navigation and the garrison are built during init(), not on
 * the first frame of play; A* is rationed to `ai.pathsPerFrame` solves per frame;
 * and per-actor cost is graded by view distance in `_updateRelevance`: the pose
 * is evaluated every frame / every second / every third, and an actor past a
 * fraction of the shadow distance leaves the cascades. An actor that provably
 * cannot reach a pixel at all takes the cheapest tier of both.
 *
 * EVENTS consumed: weapon:fire, bullet:impact, damage:dealt, explosion,
 *   equipment:flash, player:footstep, streak:uav
 * EVENTS emitted: weapon:fire (enemy muzzle), weapon:shell, bullet:tracer,
 *   damage:dealt (enemy hitting the player, and — with `applied` — the report
 *   of blast damage this system applied to its own agents), actor:death,
 *   actor:footstep

   * and decals behind and blew the pixel gate. Nothing here is a gameplay object.

   *    `THREE.Color` uniform and is deliberately absent from
   *    `customProgramCacheKey`, so livery 0's programs are livery 11's.
   *    It MUST be handed `MATERIAL_SLOTS` in the builder's own order:
   *    three sorts opaque draws (including the nine groups inside one soldier) by
   *    the global `Material.id` counter, so creating them in any other order
   *    reorders those draws and flips the depth tie on coplanar surfaces. That is
   *    a measured 2-pixel gate failure, not a theory — see MATERIAL_SLOTS.
   *  - the programs are compiled against a throwaway scene holding ONE dummy
   *    SkinnedMesh. The permutation three compiles is decided by the material
   *    plus the object's features (skinning, vertex colours, uv) and the target
   *    scene's lights, so a 6-triangle stand-in with the real 25-bone skeleton
   *    and the real vertex attributes yields the same programs a soldier does.
   *  - the cascade depth variant is compiled too, by borrowing render's own
   *    override material: `compileAsync` only ever looks at `object.material`, so
   *    the skinned depth program is otherwise not reachable without rendering a
   *    shadow map.

   * Decide, per actor, whether anything it does this frame can reach a pixel.
   *
   * An actor is IRRELEVANT only when both of these hold:
   *   1. its (already 1.45x inflated) bounding sphere, grown by a further 4 m,
   *      misses the camera frustum — so it is not drawn, and no screen-space
   *      effect can sample it either, because it is not in the depth buffer;
   *   2. the volume its sun shadow could possibly darken misses the frustum too.
   *      For a directional light that volume is exactly the actor's sphere swept
   *      along -sunDir: a visible surface can only be shadowed by this actor if
   *      the ray from that surface toward the sun passes through it. Sweeping to
   *      where the ray leaves the level below the floor covers every receiver,
   *      ground or wall, and the 4 m of slack absorbs both the soft-shadow filter
   *      radius (up to ~1 m of cascade texels) and a frame of camera motion.
   *
   * Irrelevant actors animate at a third of the rate and are dropped from the
   * shadow cascades (`userData.owNoShadow`, which render honours per frame). They
   * are still simulated, still shootable, still make noise — only the parts that
   * can exclusively affect pixels are skipped.
   *
   * Relevance is not a boolean, though, and treating it as one left the whole
   * middle of the curve unpriced: a bot in frame at 80 m posed, solved three IK
   * chains and cast into the cascades at exactly the cost of one at 5 m, for a
   * silhouette a few pixels across. So the same pass also grades the two things
   * that fall off with distance:
   *
   *   - `animEvery` (see `Agent._drive`) — full rate inside `ANIM_NEAR`, half to
   *     `ANIM_FAR`, a third beyond it or when the actor cannot be seen at all.
   *   - sun shadow casting, dropped past `_actorShadowCut()`. The cascades
   *     already cull a caster that cannot reach them (`src/render/csm.js`
   *     `_cullCascade`), so this only ever removes an actor from a cascade it
   *     genuinely lands in — the far, coarse one, where its own shadow is a
   *     handful of texels.
   *
   * Both tiers are hysteretic. The shadow one has to be: a bot loitering on the
   * threshold would otherwise drop and restore its shadow every frame, which
   * reads as a flickering silhouette on the ground and is far more visible than
   * the shadow being absent.
