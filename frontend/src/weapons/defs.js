/**
 * Weapon data.
 *
 * Ballistics are real: 5.56x45 leaves a 14.5" barrel at ~880 m/s, 9x19 from a
 * 4.5" barrel at ~360 m/s, and both drop under gravity on the way to the
 * target. Rates of fire, magazine capacities and ADS times are the real ones
 * too (an M4A1 is 800 rpm and reaches the optic in about 220 ms).
 *
 * Recoil is split in two, exactly as a modern shooter does it:
 *   - `pattern`  a DETERMINISTIC per-shot camera climb a player can memorise
 *                and counter. Generated once from a fixed seed.
 *   - `spread`   a random cone that grows with sustained fire and shrinks when
 *                aiming, crouched or still. This is the part you cannot learn.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE BALANCE CONTRACT
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A body is 100 HP and `src/ai` scales incoming damage by the zone it lands in:
 * head x4.0, upper torso x1.0, lower torso x0.9, arm x0.65, leg x0.7. So base
 * damage is not a feel number — it is a SHOTS-TO-KILL number, and each weapon's
 * identity is which side of an integer boundary it lands on:
 *
 *   weapon  dmg   torso STK   rpm    TTK (upper torso)   head
 *   rifle    33      4        800        225 ms          1 shot (132)
 *   smg      26      4        950        189 ms          1 shot (104)
 *   g31      29      4        480        375 ms          1 shot (116)
 *   sniper  115      1         50        one shot        1 shot (460)
 *
 * The SMG wins inside ~18 m and the carbine everywhere past it — which is what
 * `falloffStart/falloffEnd/dropoff` below are for, and the reason the SMG's is
 * so much steeper. Before this pass the SMG did 24 (a 5-shot kill at 950 rpm =
 * 253 ms) with a WIDER hip cone than the carbine, so it lost at every range and
 * in every stance: strictly dominated, the one thing a weapon set may never do.
 *
 * The AX-7 sits outside that table on purpose. It kills in one shot on any HEAD
 * or TORSO hit at any range the round survives (115 x 0.9 = 103.5 on the lower
 * torso), and in exactly two on a LIMB — which is the whole balance: a hit is
 * lethal, a clipped arm hands the target 1.2 s of bolt cycle to kill you back.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * DAMAGE FALLOFF — a two-point ramp, not a curve
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Falloff used to be `1 - (1 - dropoff) * (travelled/maxRange)^2` over the
 * round's whole FLIGHT range. Measured against real engagement distances that
 * did essentially nothing: the SMG kept 99.4 % of its damage at 25 m and 92.8 %
 * at 60 m, because a quadratic over 240 m is flat everywhere a fight happens.
 * Range was therefore not a balance lever at all, and the only thing separating
 * the weapons was rate of fire.
 *
 * It is now the standard two-point ramp every modern shooter uses, decoupled
 * from flight distance:
 *   - full damage out to `falloffStart`
 *   - a straight ramp to `dropoff` of it at `falloffEnd`
 *   - flat beyond, until `maxRange` retires the round
 * so the numbers below are readable as metres on a map.

     * Weapon-local origin is the web of the shooting hand (top of the grip).
     * The butt pad is at z=+0.245, the muzzle crown at z=-0.502, the optic
     * ocular at (0, 0.142, +0.006) and the mag floorplate ~150 mm below origin.
     *
     * SOLVED FROM THE BORE AXIS, not from where the optic happens to land.
     *
     * The previous pose (hipPos [0.081,-0.192,-0.215], hipRot [-0.026,0.076,
     * 0.055]) was derived by putting the OPTIC at a chosen screen position, and
     * that is the wrong constraint: it left the bore 1.5 deg nose-down with the
     * weapon only 215 mm from the eye, so the whole barrel forward of the
     * receiver ran off the top-left of the frame and the muzzle crown — where
     * the flash spawns — projected onto empty street. What reads as "the gun
     * points at the crosshair" is the MUZZLE being visible, up-left of the
     * receiver, on the way to the centre of the screen.
     *
     * Constraints, in order:
     *   1. bore axis 4.0 deg LEFT of view-forward (converging on the crosshair)
     *      and 2.9 deg nose-down:  rx = -0.050, ry = +0.070
     *   2. rolled 7.7 deg so the LEFT flank of the receiver (the side that
     *      carries the rollmark, the bolt catch and the port) faces the camera
     *      and the rail deck turns edge-on instead of presenting its lit top
     *      face:  rz = -0.135
     *   3. muzzle crown inside x 1050-1300, y 620-780 at 1920x1080
     *   4. optic ocular below and right of screen centre
     *   5. magazine + pistol grip in the lower-right frame
     *
     * With the rotation above the muzzle offset is (-0.025, +0.049, -0.505) and
     * the ocular offset (+0.019, +0.141, -0.003), so at a 60 deg vertical view
     * FOV (half-height 0.5774|z|, half-width 1.0264|z|):
     *   muzzle -> (1064, 698)   ocular -> (1374, 677)   magwell mouth -> (1268, 870)
     * i.e. the muzzle is 300 px up-LEFT of the optic and heading for the middle
     * of the frame, which is the read that was missing.
     *
     * z = -0.30 (was -0.215) is what makes the weapon small enough for the mag
     * and grip to enter the frame at all: the gun's vertical extent from optic
     * to floorplate is 291 mm, and at 215 mm from the eye that is 93% of the
     * frame height. It is also the limit — the support hand is then 620 mm
     * downrange of a shoulder 200 mm off the eye, and a 572 mm arm has nothing
     * left. The butt pad ends up 60 mm in FRONT of the eye but 140 mm off axis,
     * so it is outside the frustum rather than clipped by the near plane. */

     *                    the frame height, and every critic called the optic
     *                    oversized. 0.115 puts it at 168 px (336 px across,
     *                    31% of frame height), which is where a modern shooter
     *                    frames a tube sight.
     *   sight picture    is stopped by the objective bore at (relief + len), so a
     *                    LONGER relief improves the picture-to-housing ratio:
     *                    (relief)/(relief+len) goes from 0.53 to 0.69.

  /**
   * THE QUICKSCOPE RIFLE.
   *
   * Every number below serves one loop, and it is the loop Call of Duty and
   * Counter-Strike both build a whole skill ceiling on:
   *
   *     flick onto the target -> scope -> the instant the glass is up the
   *     round goes exactly where the crosshair is -> one hit anywhere on the
   *     head or torso ends it -> 1.2 s of bolt cycle, during which you are a
   *     man holding a 932 mm rifle in a corridor.
   *
   * Four mechanics carry it, and they are all in this block:
   *
   *  1. `spreadAds: 0.02`. A cone of 0.02 deg is 1.7 cm at 50 m — the shot goes
   *     where the reticle is, full stop. That is the non-negotiable half of
   *     quickscoping: if a scoped sniper round can miss a stationary head, the
   *     technique does not exist. Counter-Strike's AWP is the same contract.
   *  2. `spreadHip: 6.5`. And the other half. A 6.5 deg cone is 5.7 m across at
   *     50 m, so a no-scope is a lottery ticket, not a playstyle. The entire
   *     value of the weapon is gated behind the scope being up.
   *  3. `spreadDecay: 24`. This is the number that MAKES the technique work and
   *     it is the least obvious. Spread relaxes toward its resting value at
   *     `spreadDecay * (1 + adsProgress)` deg/s, so at the carbine's 3.6 the
   *     6.5 deg hip cone would take 0.9 s to bleed down after the scope was
   *     already up — you would be scoped, on target, and still missing. At 24 it
   *     is gone in 0.14 s, comfortably inside the 0.34 s `adsTime`, so the scope
   *     coming up IS the shot being ready. Nothing else gates it.
   *  4. `rpm: 50` and `spreadPerShot: 3.2`. The cost. One shot every 1.2 s, and
   *     the cone is blown to 3.2 deg the instant you fire, so there is no such
   *     thing as a fast second shot even if you could cycle faster.
   *
   * `adsFovScale: 0.3` is the scope: a 3.3x picture against the carbine's 1.4x.
   * `adsTime: 0.34` is slow enough to lose a close-quarters trade and fast
   * enough to win a flick — which is exactly where a sniper belongs.
