 * Everything comes out of `ctx.get('materials')` — the shared procedural PBR
 * library — re-tuned for hand-held scale. Three things matter at 0.4 m from the
 * eye and are what these overrides are for:
 *
 *  1. TEXEL DENSITY. The library bakes surfaces for architecture (a 2.5 m
 *     tile). A weapon needs a 0.10-0.15 m tile plus a detail layer at ~8 mm, or
 *     the receiver reads as smooth plastic. `detail[3]` (the fade distance) is
 *     pulled in to 3-6 m so the micro layer is at full strength in the hand.
 *  2. OBJECT-SPACE PROJECTION. `localSpace + triplanar` means the texture is
 *     nailed to the mesh, so nothing swims while the viewmodel animates, and no
 *     UV unwrap is needed for procedurally merged geometry.
 *  3. EDGE WEAR. Every weapon geometry gets curvature vertex masks baked
 *     (see materials.bakeMasks), and these materials turn that mask into bare
 *     bright metal on the chamfers of high-contact parts — the single most
 *     important cue that a gun has been used.
 *
 * World-space weathering (rain streaks, ground splash) is switched off: it is
 * driven by world Y, which is meaningless for something parented to the camera.
 * Cavity grime (weather.w) is height-driven and stays on.

       *   rail          0.0033        L=106            L=192

       * PERCENT of what the eye saw on the gun was Fresnel. That is the whole

       *   2. albedo x3. 0.098 -> 0.285 puts the anodising at ~0.0095 linear.
       *      Still a third of physical (a real oxide is 0.026-0.032) because the
       *      viewmodel rig delivers far more irradiance per unit albedo than the
       *      world does, but now it is DIFFUSE-dominant, which is the only regime
       *      in which the detail layer, the wear mask, the grime and the hue
       *      separation from the polymer can be seen at all.
