 *                 grips, magazines, optics, iron sights, triggers.
 *   models/*.js   the three weapons assembled from those parts.
 *   hands.js      gloved hands + sleeved arms, two-bone IK from the hand.

 *   weapon:reload  { weapon, phase: 'start'|'magout'|'magin'|'end', empty }
 *                  No position: this is the player's own reload, and `audio`
 *                  reads a missing position as "head-locked". `ai` must send one.
 *                  `empty` distinguishes a dry reload from a tactical one; it
 *                  selects the reload foley for the phases where the two really
 *                  differ (magout, end) and defaults to false when absent.
 *   bullet:tracer  { from, to, speed }
 *   explosion      { position, radius, damage }   frag detonation
 *   equipment:flash{ position, radius, duration } stun detonation
 * `bullet:impact` comes from physics, because physics owns penetration.
 * Anything else (ammo counts, fire mode, the current weapon) is a getter on
 * this object rather than an event, so no new event types are introduced.

   *     "Dry" is judged against `wasEmpty`, the state BEFORE this frame's

   *     a click, and must not have its cycle swallowed by an instant reload;
   *   - running dry without pulling again arms a short countdown instead:
   *     the last shot's cycle (`_fireTimer`, which on the bolt gun is the
   *     whole bolt stroke) plus a beat, so the shot reads before the reload
   *     starts.

   *     mid-animation loses the clip before `magin` lands any ammo) simply

   *   - a draw or inspect clip in flight — the auto path waits for the hands
   *     rather than cutting the animation the way a deliberate R does, which
   *     is what makes switch-to-empty-weapon look right: holster, draw, then
   *     the reload;
   *   - a cooking grenade owns the weapon hand until it is thrown;
   *   - no reserve left — nothing to load, so the countdown never arms and
   *     `reload()` is not spammed every frame.
   *

    // the grab because the harness pumps on its own rAF chain, which can land a
    // frame either side of the engine's.

    // frame the shutter lands on is only known to within a handful of frames
    // (the harness pumps its settle count on its own rAF chain, then the
    // screenshot RPC costs a few more). So: three spaced rounds early to fill
    // the frame with drifting smoke, brass in flight and a tracer, then a
    // sustained tail on a 2-frame cadence, so a flash is lit continuously
    // across the whole uncertainty window.
    //
    // The cadence was 3 frames, which is the flash core's own lifetime rounded
    // UP: measured across settle 86/88/90/92/94, frame 90 landed in the trough
    // between two cores and photographed a dying flash (10k hot pixels against
    // 26-29k on either side). Two frames guarantees overlap.
