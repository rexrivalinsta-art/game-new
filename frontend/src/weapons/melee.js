/**
 * MELEE — the quick strike on V: a weapon-butt jab that closes the last two
 * metres of a fight without asking the magazine's permission.
 *
 * It is a separate key, not a weapon slot: pressing it plays the `melee` clip
 * on whatever is in the hands, the hit lands on the clip's `strike` beat so the
 * damage arrives when the butt visibly connects, and the whole exchange is
 * bounded by one recovery window — no combos, no lunge, no holstering.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE HIT TEST
 * A melee that only connects on a pixel-perfect centre ray feels broken at the
 * range it exists for, so the strike is FORGIVING: a fan of rays approximating
 * a 0.58 m-wide capsule at full reach — three lateral offsets by three heights
 * around the camera bore (`FAN`, pinned by the self-test). Each ray is a real
 * `physics.raycast` against MASK.BULLET, which is what makes cover honest: a
 * ray that meets a wall before flesh hits the wall, closest-hit, and there is
 * no way to stab through a barricade the round could not cross.
 *
 * Bots are settled here — the nearest actor across the fan takes the damage as
 * a `damage:dealt`, exactly the payload physics emits for a bullet, so the
 * hitmarker, the killfeed, the killstreak counter and the announcer all work
 * without knowing melee exists. Remote players carry no actor colliders, so the
 * fan cannot see them: `net` listens to `weapon:melee` and runs the same reach
 * and backstab arithmetic against its own puppet capsules (`_onLocalMelee`),
 * reading the numbers off `weapons.melee` so the two damage models cannot
 * drift apart — the same contract as `damageAt()`.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE BACKSTAB
 * 45 from the front or side leaves the victim alive and turning; 100 from
 * inside the victim's rear cone is the kill the flank earned. The cone is the
 * dot of the victim's facing with the unit vector back at the attacker, in the
 * ground plane: `facing · toAttacker <= -0.45` (about a 127° arc behind them).
 * Height is deliberately ignored — a backstab from a balcony is still a
 * backstab.
 *
 * EVENTS EMITTED
 *   weapon:melee   { origin, dir, reach, damage }  every swing, on the strike
 *                  beat, hit or miss — `net` settles PvP off it and `audio`/
 *                  `fx` may score the swing itself
 *   damage:dealt   { target, amount, headshot, killed, point, part, incident }
 *                  only when the fan finds an actor — same shape physics emits
