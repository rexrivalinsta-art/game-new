 * contact solve that wraps the support hand onto the real handguard. That is
 * what makes a hand look like it is HOLDING something, and none of it changed.
 *
 * What no longer exists is the arm over that rig. The full upper-arm/forearm
 * sleeves were the single largest occluder in the frame — the support forearm
 * crossed the lower third of every hipfire shot as a 90 mm-wide faceted tube —
 * and every attempt to frame them (shoulder placement, bone lengths, sleeve
 * radii) traded reach against screen coverage. So the sleeves are gone. Each
 * glove keeps a short wrist stub aimed along the solved forearm line, which is
 * the whole "connected to a body" read: hands-plus-stub is the convention every
 * VR shooter ships, and the eye accepts it without a second look. The two-bone
 * solve still runs — the elbow it produces is what aims the stub.
