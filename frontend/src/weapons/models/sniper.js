/**
 * The bolt-action marksman rifle — an AI AX / L115-flavoured .338 on an
 * aluminium chassis: heavy fluted barrel, side-baffle brake, folded bipod, a
 * skeleton chassis stock with an adjustable comb, and a 3.3x tube scope in a
 * one-piece mount.
 *
 * WHY IT IS BUILT SEPARATELY AND NOT AS A LONG CARBINE.
 *
 * Three silhouette facts carry "sniper" at the 40-60 px of screen width the
 * rear half of a weapon occupies in hipfire, and a stretched M4 has none of
 * them:
 *
 *   1. THE BOLT HANDLE. A 45 mm shaft with a ball knob standing out of the
 *      right flank of the action, level with the shooter's eye in ADS. It is
 *      the single most recognisable feature on the class and it is a MOVING
 *      part here — it is thrown on every shot (see boltTravel), which is what
 *      sells the 1.2 s cycle as mechanical rather than as a cooldown.
 *   2. THE THUMBHOLE. `addChassisStock` cuts a hole clean through the stock.
 *      Nothing else in the game's silhouette vocabulary has one.
 *   3. THE OBJECTIVE BELL. A 56 mm front lens on a 35 mm tube, hooded, and the
 *      scope is 105 mm long against the carbine red dot's 52 mm.
 *
 * Layout (weapon-local metres, origin at the shooting hand's thumb web):
 *   bore axis        y = +0.078
 *   rail deck        y = +0.108   (30 mm over bore, one continuous rail)
 *   optic centre     y = +0.173   (95 mm over bore — see the note on `opticY`)
 *   action           z = +0.088 .. -0.152
 *   chassis forend   z = -0.156 .. -0.512
 *   muzzle crown     z = -0.660
 *   butt pad         z = +0.272
 * Overall 932 mm, 25 % longer than the carbine's 747 mm.

  /**
   * THE ACTION IS `alu`, AND THE FIRST ATTEMPT AT `steel_black` IS WHY.
   *
   * A bolt action really is a machined steel receiver bedded into an aluminium
   * chassis, which is the reverse of the AR's alloy-receiver/steel-barrel split,
   * and building it that way was the whole idea: the same three material classes
   * arranged differently, so the two rifles read as different weapons at 40 px.
   *
   * Measured in the hipfire frame it produced the exact defect the carbine's
   * material notes are about. `steel_black` is a METAL — no albedo, only an F0 —
   * and the action's flank is a 240 x 42 mm flat slab presented almost edge-on
   * to the eye and sitting right in the viewmodel rim light's reflection path.
   * It rendered as a cream-white bar down the middle of the frame: "unpainted
   * MDF", the same read the optic bezel and the charging handle both had to be
   * moved off metal to cure. The `alu` class exists for precisely this — it is a
   * dielectric oxide and takes the specular clamp (see materials.js) — and the
   * chamfer wear mask puts bare aluminium back on the corners where a receiver
   * actually polishes through.
   *
   * The class contrast survives anyway, because it was never really about the
   * receiver: the barrel here is 480 mm of exposed `steel` against the carbine's
   * 90 mm, and that is the read.

   *
   * The rotation is solved rather than eyeballed. The handle points outboard,
   * down and slightly back: d = (0.939, -0.280, 0.200). An Euler in three's XYZ
   * order sends +Z to (sin y, -sin x cos y, cos x cos y), so
   *   sin y = 0.939            -> ry = 1.2185
   *   sin x = 0.280 / cos y    -> rx = 0.951
   * and cos x cos y = 0.200 falls out, which is the check.
   *
   * Down matters as much as out: a handle that only goes sideways reads as a peg,
   * and the reason a bolt knob is raked down is that a hand comes off the grip
   * and up to it. This is the shape the eye reads as "bolt gun" from the side.
