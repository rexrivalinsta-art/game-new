/**
 * SAMPLES — sampled voices, behind the same contract as the synthesized ones.
 *
 * Every voice factory in weapons.js / foley.js / vox.js returns
 * `{ node, end, send }`: a node already scheduled to sound at `when`, the
 * context time it finishes, and how much reverb it wants. This module returns
 * exactly that, built from a decoded AudioBuffer instead of an oscillator
 * stack, so AudioSystem._build() can prefer a sample and fall through to
 * synthesis without either side knowing about the other.
 *
 * Everything here degrades to "no sample" rather than throwing: a missing
 * manifest, a 404, a codec the browser will not decode, or a buffer that has
 * not finished loading all mean the procedural voice plays instead. The game
 * is never silent because an asset is late or absent.
 *
 * Assets are produced by tools/encode-sfx.mjs — mono 48 kHz Opus, trimmed to
 * the transient, peak-normalized. See public/sfx/CREDITS.md.
