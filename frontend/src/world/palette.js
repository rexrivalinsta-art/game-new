       *
       * Site Work is set at ten at night, so these three are not decoration —
       * they are most of what the map is lit by, and every one of them is
       * EMISSIVE ONLY. No punctual light, no shader permutation, following the
       * Loop's shopfronts and blade sign for the reason `world/index.js` spells
       * out at length: three bakes the number of VISIBLE point lights into the
       * program cache key, so a map that scatters practicals recompiles every
       * lit material in the frame as you walk past them. Emissive geometry
       * costs a draw call and nothing else.
       *
       * The actual illumination comes from six lamp anchors, which the world
       * ramps on solar altitude and which the light ballast already counts.
