/**
 * WORLD — the map list.
 *
 * The level used to be a single hard-coded build sequence inside
 * `WorldSystem.init`. It is now one of these descriptors, so a second map is a
 * new module rather than a fork of the world subsystem, and so the player can
 * choose one on the Match Start screen.
 *
 * A MAP DESCRIPTOR provides the level itself. Its menu NAME and DESCRIPTION are
 * not here — they live in `REGISTRY` below, beside the enable flag and the menu
 * order, so that one table answers "what ships, in what order, called what".
 *
 *   id           stable string, used in the URL (`?map=rust`) and on the wire
 *   blurb        two lines of "what is it like to play"
 *   size         human-readable extent, for the menu card
 *   transform    { yaw, tx, tz } — LEVEL -> WORLD, baked into every vertex
 *   bounds       [minX,minY,minZ, maxX,maxY,maxZ] of the playable area, LEVEL
 *   spawnPoints  the authored spawn table (see src/world/spawns.js)
 *   standable    (x, z, margin) => boolean, LEVEL space — the cheap first
 *                filter the spawn validator applies before real collision
 *   groundY      (x, z) => number — analytic floor height, LEVEL space
 *   isOpen       (x, z, margin) => boolean — where a character can stand
 *                outdoors; this is what `ui/minimap` draws as floor
 *   build(A,rng) assemble the level into `A`; returns { buildings }
 *   environment  OPTIONAL { hour, weather, exposureBias } — the sky this map is
 *                set under. `hour` is local solar time, 0..24; `weather` is a
 *                patch over the sky's defaults (`turbidity`, `cloudCoverage`,
 *                `cloudDensity`, `cirrusCoverage`, `cirrusOpacity`,
 *                `horizonMurk`, `windSpeed`, `windAngle`, `fogDensity`,
 *                `fogHeight`, `shaftGain` — see `sky.setWeather`);
 *                `exposureBias` is EV of metering compensation the map adds to
 *                the sky's own, positive being darker, for a level whose own
 *                lights carry the frame. `world` hands the whole thing to
 *                `sky.applyEnvironment` on every build, and a map WITHOUT one
 *                restores the sky's defaults rather than inheriting the last
 *                map's — so a night map cannot leak into a day one. The Loop is
 *                the only map that carries one today.
 *
 * `build` must register its own prop prototypes and must draw only from the
 * `rng` it is handed — the world's fork — so a capture run stays reproducible.
 */
/**
 * THE REGISTRY — the one table to edit.
 *
 * Everything that is a DEPLOY decision rather than a level-design one lives
 * here, so "what ships, in what order, called what" is one file to read:
 *
 *   map          the descriptor module
 *   order        menu position, low to high. Sparse on purpose (10, 20, 30…)
 *                so a map can be slotted between two others without renumbering
 *                the rest. Ties break on registry position.
 *   enabled      false hides it from the menu, the URL and the boot resolver.
 *                It is NOT deleted: `ALL_MAPS` still carries it and
 *                `maps.selftest.mjs` still builds it, so a parked map cannot
 *                rot quietly and come back broken.
 *   name         what the menu shows
 *   description  one line under the name
 *
 * `name`/`description` live here rather than on the descriptor so that the
 * modules stay pure geometry, and so there is exactly one place a menu string
 * can be wrong. The descriptor keeps `blurb` and `size` — those are written
 * with the level, not with the release.
 *
 * This list is a MODULE, not `game.json`, because it holds live references to
 * `build`/`standable`/`groundY` closures, because `resolveBootMap` needs it
 * synchronously at boot, and because `maps.selftest.mjs` runs under node where
 * a fetch of the public root would silently resolve to nothing.
