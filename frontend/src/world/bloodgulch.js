/**
 * WORLD — BLOOD GULCH.
 *
 * A box canyon with a base at each end, after the Halo map. 104 x 72 m of grass
 * between two rock walls, and PERFORMANCE IS THE BRIEF — the map is authored to
 * be the cheapest thing in the game to draw, and every decision below that could
 * have gone the other way went this way for that reason:
 *
 *   FLAT SURFACES        every key is `bg_*` (palette.js): one shared 256 bake,
 *                        tinted. No normal maps, no weathering, no vertex
 *                        masks, no macro variation — those blocks compile out
 *                        of the shader entirely rather than being multiplied by
 *                        zero at runtime.
 *   BLOCKED-OUT FORMS    cliffs, buttresses, ridges and the central spire are
 *                        chamfered boxes at a few degrees to one another. A
 *                        canyon wall is the largest thing on screen at all
 *                        times, and it costs ~44 triangles per block.
 *   TWO PROTOTYPES       a boulder and a scatter stone (`bloodgulchprops.js`).
 *   NO SHARED PROP LIB   `registerProps` is deliberately NOT called: it builds
 *                        ~70 prototype geometries this map never places, and
 *                        every one of them is build-time work and garbage on a
 *                        map that wants neither.
 *   NO OUTER COLLISION   the terrain beyond the cliffs carries no proxy. The
 *                        perimeter is sealed, so nothing out there is reachable
 *                        and its triangles would only be BVH physics walks.
 *
 * The whole map lands at 13 draw calls against a budget of 320.
 *
 * LAYOUT (LEVEL space, origin at the canyon centre, north at -Z, x is the
 * base-to-base axis):
 *
 *        -Z                          x = -52 .. +52,  z = -36 .. +36

 *
 *   THE BASES     20 x 18 m, mirrored by a half-turn, 62 m apart. Each is a
 *                 walled courtyard open to the sky through an 8 x 8 m hole in
 *                 its roof, with a 10 m mouth facing the field, a back door,
 *                 a door in each side wall and a flag stand in the middle.
 *                 Both are enterable — the courtyard is real floor the minimap
 *                 draws and spawns use.
 *   THE RAMPS     two per base, on the outside of the side walls, running from
 *                 the FRONT corner back up to the roof. Deliberately the most
 *                 exposed approach on the map: the roof overlooks everything,
 *                 so it is priced by having to climb it in the open. The roof
 *                 ring drops back into the courtyard through the hole, which is
 *                 the escape that keeps the roof from being a trap.
 *   THE TOOTH     a 15.5 m rock spire at the centre. It is the landmark, and it
 *                 is load-bearing: without it the two base mouths look straight
 *                 down 42 m of open grass at each other.
 *   THE LANES     the field splits around the Tooth into a north and a south
 *                 lane, each broken by rock ridges every ~10 m so neither is an
 *                 unbroken firing line.
 *   THE BACK      11 m behind each base, reached through the back door or round
 *                 either side, closed by a rockslide where the canyon carries
 *                 on. Every space on this map has at least two ways out.
 *
 * PROVENANCE AND DEVIATIONS. Halo's canyon is roughly 250 x 130 m with the
 * bases ~200 m apart, which is three times the distance this game's weapons and
 * eight-player count are built for. It is CROPPED to its fighting core rather
 * than shrunk uniformly: base proportions, the roof-hole courtyard, the twin
 * ramps and the rockslide ends are kept at true size, the distance between them
 * is not. The other deliberate departures, each because a faithful copy plays
 * worse here:
 *
 *   - The floor is FLAT. The real gulch rolls; every rise on this map is built
 *     on top of a flat plane instead, which is what lets the whole playable
 *     area collide as one box (see `groundYBloodGulch`).
 *   - The base tunnels and teleporters are gone. This engine has no teleport,
 *     and an underground passage is a second floor of collision for a route
 *     the side doors already provide.
 *   - Ramps are STAIRS. The controller mantles ~0.5 m and climbs no ladders;
 *     `stairRun` is the sanctioned way up and carries its own collision.
 *   - The bases are rotationally symmetric rather than mirrored, so neither
 *     ramp pair faces the other across the field.
 *
 * Authored in LEVEL space; `WorldSystem` bakes the level->world transform into
 * every vertex, proxy and light, so nothing below knows about world space.

   * Mid-morning, clear, and the sun deliberately lower than noon — 9:30 sits
   * around 50° rather than the 62° of 10:30, and on this map that is a
   * legibility decision rather than a mood one.
   *
   * Every surface here is flat-shaded with no normal map, so the only thing
   * that separates one vertical face from another is the angle it makes with
   * the sun. Under a high sun the vertical faces are all lit by sky alone and
   * come out the same value. A lower sun lights one side of everything vertical
   * and lays long shadows across a floor that is otherwise one unbroken green.
   * It is only half the answer, though, and the smaller half: the map faces
   * both ways, so one end is always backlit. What actually keeps the landmark
   * off the canyon wall is `bg_spire`'s albedo — see `buildTooth`.
   *
   * Clear air is also the cheap choice: `cloudCoverage` low enough that the sky
   * is a gradient rather than a cloud field, and no cirrus layer at all.
   * `fogHeight` stays above the cliff line so the tops sit back in it.
