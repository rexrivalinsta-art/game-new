/**
 * WORLD — SITE WORK.
 *
 * A live construction site inside a sealed orange hoarding: a half-built
 * concrete frame across the middle, a lift-shaft core standing over each half
 * of the ground, and a materials yard at either end. 56 x 84 m of playable
 * ground.
 *
 *   THE FRAME     the map's spine — a 34 x 14 m concrete deck on columns,
 *                 straddling the middle of the site. It is ENTERABLE, with six
 *                 doorways, and its roof at 3.8 m is the map's contested
 *                 middle ground. Two external stairs reach it, one from each
 *                 side, so taking it always means crossing open ground.
 *   THE CORE      a 13.5 m lift-shaft tower north of the frame — the landmark,
 *                 visible from every corner of the site. Its deck at 7.2 m is
 *                 the strongest position on the map and it is priced
 *                 accordingly: the only way up is a 7.2 m external flight
 *                 standing in the open.
 *   THE LANES     three independent north-south routes: a 15 m west haul road,
 *                 a 7 m east service gap, and straight through the frame. No
 *                 space on this map has one exit.
 *   THE YARDS     a materials yard at each end, each with a shed breaking the
 *                 sightline down the site, and the bulk of the spawn points.
 *
 * PROVENANCE. Proportions were read off a downloaded low-poly TDM site model
 * with `tools/glb-plan.mjs` and `tools/glb-render.mjs` — a sealed orange
 * hoarding, a spine building across the middle, two towers flanking it, gravel
 * yards at both ends, and a palette of safety orange, concrete grey, timber and
 * brick red. The model measured 18.7 x 36 m at its true scale (calibrated off
 * its oil drums at 0.58 x 0.88 m), which is a third of this game's 55-120 m
 * band, so POSITIONS were scaled ~3x while props stayed their real size. See
 * the deviations noted at each site below. Nothing from the model is loaded,
 * imported or sampled — every mesh here is generated, like the rest of the game.
 *
 * DEVIATIONS, AND WHY
 *   The source's spine seals to the east wall, leaving a single ~3 m gap at the
 *   west as the only route between the two halves. In a team mode that is a
 *   choke; in an 8-player free-for-all it is a coin flip. So the frame here is
 *   permeable (six doorways) and the east gap is real, giving three routes.
 *   The source is also 180-degree symmetric, which on a map with no team
 *   colours means no way to tell which end you are looking at. The two towers
 *   are therefore deliberately unequal — one is 13.5 m with a deck, the other
 *   9.5 m and solid — and the two end sheds differ in size and side.
 *
 * LAYOUT NOTES
 *   Authored in LEVEL space, site centred on the origin, north at -Z.
 *   `WorldSystem` bakes the level->world transform into every vertex, proxy and
 *   light, so nothing below knows about world space.
 *
 *   Verticality is stairs only — this engine's controller mantles ~0.5 m ledges
 *   and climbs no ladders, so a deck without a flight is scenery. Exactly two
 *   places are positions: the frame roof and the core deck. Everything else
 *   that is tall is cover.
