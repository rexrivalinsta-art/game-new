/**
 * WORLD — MARKET, the original map, as a map descriptor.
 *
 * This is the ~120 x 120 m Middle-Eastern market street the game shipped with:
 * one main street with a plaza, flanking alleys, eighteen buildings (three of
 * them enterable and furnished over multiple floors), an arched gate closing
 * the vista, and several thousand props.
 *
 * The build sequence below is EXACTLY the one that used to live inline in
 * `WorldSystem.init` — same order, same RNG draw order — because the capture
 * baselines in `tools/baseline.mjs` are pixel comparisons against this map and
 * a reordered `rng` call would move every one of them.
 *
 * See `maps.js` for what a map descriptor has to provide.
