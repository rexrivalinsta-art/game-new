/**
 * WORLD — Site Work's own instanced prop library.
 *
 * `props.js` is the market's vocabulary and every prototype in it is dressed
 * for a lived-in street: weathered wood, rusted steel, litter, sandbags. Site
 * Work is a blockout, so it needs a handful of those objects with all of that
 * taken away — and it needs them as SEPARATE prototypes rather than as a remap
 * of the shared ones, because `crate_a` and `barrel_rust` are placed by five
 * other maps that did not ask to be restyled. (`Assembler.proto` returns early
 * on a duplicate id, so a remap is not available even if it were wanted.)
 *
 * ELEVEN PROTOTYPES COVER THE WHOLE MAP, and that is not a shortcut, it is the
 * look. Three of the eleven are emissive companions — barrel bands and cabin
 * edge strips — drawn at the same transform as the object they light, which is
 * how a night map gets two materials onto a single merged mesh. The reference this map is styled after is built from a crate, a brick
 * pallet, an empty pallet, a barrel and a barrier, repeated — no scrap piles,
 * no pipe runs, no generators, no rebar. The first pass at this map dressed it
 * with twenty-six of the shared industrial props and it read as a detailed
 * site; a blockout has no debris, and the moment it does it stops reading as
 * one.
 *
 * Each comes out of `PB` as ONE merged geometry, so it is one instanced draw
 * call per chunk however many boxes went into it, and every part is a chamfered
 * box or a cylinder. Nothing here needs a normal map to do its job — the
 * corrugation on a cabin is real geometry, because at this triangle budget it
 * is cheaper than a texture set and it survives at any distance.
 *
 * MASKS ARE LEFT AT THEIR DEFAULTS AND THEN IGNORED. `PB` writes the usual
 * wear/grime/AO vertex colours, but every `sw_*` palette key sets
 * `vertexMasks: false`, so the shader compiles that block out entirely. The
 * attribute is paid for and unread — much cheaper than forking `PB`.

/**
 * The site cabin, which is also the gate block. Container-shaped on purpose:

 * shadows its inner one, which gives the eye something to measure the map with.
 * That is exactly the job a crate does in a blockout, and it is why the
 * reference's crates are panelled rather than plain.
