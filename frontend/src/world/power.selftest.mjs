/**
 * WORLD — headless checks for the destructible power grid.
 *
 *   node src/world/power.selftest.mjs
 *
 * Every interesting property of an outage is a TIMING property: how long the
 * mains stay down, what they fall to, that they come back at all, that a second
 * generator cannot extend the dark, that the dip envelope is deterministic. A
 * capture shows one instant and cannot see any of them, and none of them throws
 * when it breaks — a grid that never restores just makes a map that is dark
 * forever, and the build, the draw calls and every layout check stay green.
 *
 * So the arithmetic lives in `power.js` with no lights, no materials and no
 * `THREE` in it, and this drives a whole outage in about a millisecond.
