/**
 * WORLD — NUKETOWN.
 *
 * A deliberately stripped-back take on the classic Call of Duty map: two
 * suburban houses facing each other across a street, inside a sealed test-site
 * compound. 51 x 42 m of playable ground.
 *
 *   THE STREET    12 m of gridded deck running north-south through the middle,
 *                 with a kerb each side. It is the map's spine and its longest
 *                 sightline, broken every 8 m by a staggered barricade so it is
 *                 a fighting lane rather than a shooting gallery.
 *   THE HOUSES    two identical white masses, mirrored across the street and
 *                 offset 5 m along it so neither upstairs window looks into the
 *                 other. Both are enterable, both have a stair, and both have
 *                 first-floor windows over the street — that overlook is the
 *                 map's whole risk/reward economy.
 *   THE SIGN      a 6.4 m gantry over the middle of the street. It is the
 *                 landmark: visible from every corner, it tells you which way
 *                 you are facing the moment you spawn.
 *   THE ALLEYS    3 m behind each house, connecting the north and south ends
 *                 without crossing the street. Every space on this map has two
 *                 ways out.
 *
 * ARENA BLOCKOUT IS THE BRIEF, IN THE GEOMETRY AND IN THE SURFACES. Forms are
 * plain chamfered boxes — no foliage, no vehicles, no facade furniture — and
 * every surface comes from the five `gb_*` palette keys: flat near-white masses,
 * a blue-grey deck ruled into 1 m squares, mid-grey for the wall and the
 * horizon, and Storage Orange on the barrels and the sign as the map's single
 * accent (DESIGN.md's one-accent-per-map rule).
 *
 * Those keys are FLAT BY CONFIGURATION, not by a special shader: weathering,
 * edge wear, grime, macro variation and normal strength are all zeroed in
 * `palette.js`, which compiles the weather and vertex-mask blocks out of the
 * material entirely. Nothing here is cheaper to draw than the rest of the game
 * because it is a blockout — it is cheaper because it asks for less.
 *
 * PROVENANCE. Proportions were measured off a reference model with
 * `tools/glb-plan.mjs` (1 unit = 1 cm; houses ~11 x 15 m, 6 m eaves, ~35 m
 * centre-to-centre; 12 m road; 1.2 m yard walls; a 5.9 m sign). Nothing from
 * that model is loaded, imported or sampled — every mesh below is generated,
 * like the rest of the game. Where the reference and playability disagreed,
 * playability won and the deviation is commented at the site.
 *
 * LAYOUT NOTES
 *   Authored in LEVEL space, compound centred on the origin, north at -Z.
 *   `WorldSystem` bakes the level->world transform into every vertex, proxy and
 *   light, so nothing below knows about world space.
 *
 *   Roofs are pitched and NOT reachable — this engine's controller mantles low
 *   ledges but climbs no ladders, so the only verticality is the two interior
 *   stairs. That is deliberate: on a map this small, a reachable roof would see
 *   everything.

   * A high, thin overcast — the light a blockout is always presented under.
   *
   * `cloudCoverage` is the load-bearing number and it must stay above ~0.34:
   * below that the sheet breaks into discrete cumulus and the map gets moving
   * pools of shadow, which is the one thing that would stop the flat surfaces
   * reading as flat. Paired with a LOW `cloudDensity`, that is a bright white
   * lid rather than deep cloud.
   *
   * `hour` is doing two jobs. It sets the light, and it is what replaces the
   * map yaw (see `transform`): 15:00 puts the sun off the compound's axes so
   * the white masses still show a lit face and a shaded one. `exposureBias` is
   * EV and positive is DARKER, so the small negative here is what makes the
   * whites bright without blowing them.
