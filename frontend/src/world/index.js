/**
 * WORLD — level geometry, the modular building kit, props, set dressing and
 * static collision.
 *
 * THE MAP IS NOW A CHOICE. This system owns the machinery — the Assembler, the
 * level->world transform, spawn validation, the light budget — and a *map
 * descriptor* owns the level. Five ship today:
 *
 *   market   the ~120 m Middle-Eastern market street   (src/world/market.js)
 *   rust     a low-poly desert oil refinery            (src/world/rust.js)
 *   wilmot   a low-poly walled country estate          (src/world/wilmot.js)
 *   loop     a low-poly Chicago corner, at night       (src/world/loop.js)
 *   fishers  a low-poly estate down one pool axis      (src/world/fishers.js)
 *
 * See `src/world/maps.js` for the descriptor contract and how the boot choice
 * is resolved (`?map=` > the player's last choice > the default). Nothing is
 * loaded from disk on either map — every vertex is generated here.
 *
 * HOW IT FITS TOGETHER
 *   maps.js       the map list, the descriptor contract, the boot resolver
 *   market.js     the market's build sequence and its queries
 *   rust.js       the Rust yard: derrick, containers, sheds, spawn table
 *   layout.js     the market's map: footprints, facade programmes, set pieces
 *   util.js       geometry toolkit (chamfered boxes, wall panels with real
 *                 holes, cloth grids, catenary tubes, rocks) + vertex masks
 *   kit.js        the modular building kit (facades, windows, doors, balconies,
 *                 stairs, awnings, parapets, drainpipes, damage)
 *   buildings.js  assembles a building from a footprint + a facade programme
 *   interiors.js  furnishes rooms so an interior screenshot is worth taking
 *   props.js      the shared instanced prop library
 *   rustprops.js  the refinery's own prop library (containers, pipe, masts)
 *   wilmotprops.js the estate garden library — hedges, trees, urns, loungers;
 *                 shared by both estate maps
 *   fisherprops.js The Fisher's own: the opaque spruce, parasols, crop rows
 *   dressing.js   places the hundreds of props, cables, laundry and debris
 *   ground.js     terrain, road camber, kerbs, pavement slabs, sand drifts
 *   builder.js    the Assembler: merges statics, batches instances, authors
 *                 collision proxies, bakes the level->world transform
 *
 * PUBLIC API — `const world = ctx.get('world')`
 *   world.root                THREE.Group holding everything
 *   world.bounds              THREE.Box3 of the playable area, world space
 *   world.map                 the active map descriptor
 *   world.mapId               its id — 'market' | 'rust' | 'wilmot' | 'loop' |
 *                             'fishers' | 'nuketown' | 'bloodgulch'
 *   world.maps                [{ id, name, description, blurb, size }] for
 *                             menus — enabled maps only, in registry order
 *   world.setMap(id)          rebuild the level on another map. Awaitable, and
 *                             ONLY legal before a match goes live — see below.
 *   world.spawnPoints         [{ position:Vector3, yaw:number, tag:string }]
 *   world.spawn(i)            one of the above, by index
 *   world.spawns              the SpawnDirector (see src/world/spawns.js) —
 *                             scored, CoD-style spawn selection for players,
 *                             remote players and bots
 *   world.selectSpawn(opts)   shorthand for world.spawns.select(opts)
 *   world.groundHeight(x, z)  cheap analytic floor height (physics is exact)
 *   world.isOpen(x, z)        true where a character can stand outdoors
 *   world.stats               { staticTris, instTris, instances, drawCalls }
 *   world.prewarmMaterials()  compile every shader permutation the world can
 *                             produce, before the frame loop starts. Awaitable.
 *                             Call it from src/core/prewarm.js — see the method.
 *   world.levelToWorld(x,y,z,out) / world.worldToLevel(x,y,z,out)
 *
 * EVENTS EMITTED

   * MEASURED, not guessed. The single worst source of stalls in this build was
   * not geometry: it was shader compilation triggered by the world's own
   * practicals. `render` distance-culls every registered punctual light
   * (`light.visible = fade > 0.002`), and Three bakes the number of *visible*
   * point lights into the program cache key. The world owns 17 practicals (12
   * interior bulbs at 13 m, 5 street lamps at 22 m), so walking down the street
   * sweeps the visible count through 9-8-7-6-5-4 — and every single step
   * recompiles EVERY lit material in the frame:
   *
   *   f15 +36 programs  636 ms   f32 +35  702 ms   f41 +35  699 ms
   *   f51 +35 programs  678 ms   f99 +33  698 ms
   *   → 186 programs and ~3.5 s of stalls inside 900 frames of play
   *
   * Pre-compiling every count instead costs 9.5 s of boot (measured: 595
   * programs for counts 0-16), which is the wrong trade. Holding the count
   * still costs nothing.
   *
   * These lights are black (`color 0x000000`, `intensity 0`) with a 1 cm range,
   * parked under the map, and are NOT registered with `render.addLight`, so
   * nothing culls or re-lights them. A point light whose colour times intensity
   * is exactly 0 contributes `0.0` to irradiance — not "almost nothing", but a
   * float zero that is added to the accumulator — so this cannot move a pixel
   * no matter how many slots are lit. It only changes `numPointLights`, which
   * is a shader-permutation input and nothing else.
   *
   * Cost of the padding, measured over 3 paired runs at 1512x982 DPR 2 with 20
   * ballast slots live: p05 frame time 15.7 ms -> 14.4 ms (i.e. inside noise).
   *
   * The pool belongs to the SYSTEM, not to the level: a map change tears the
   * level's practicals down and puts new ones up, and holding the permutation
   * still across that swap is the whole point.
