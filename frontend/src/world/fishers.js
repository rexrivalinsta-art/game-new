/**
 * WORLD — THE FISHER'S.
 *
 * A low-poly take on a North Shore country place: a red-brick house under grey
 * slate at the head of a 24 m lap pool, with a flat-roofed pool house down one
 * side, a walled kitchen garden, a sunk tennis court behind an evergreen
 * screen, and a carriage house off the gravel forecourt — compressed to a
 * 56 x 70 m walled ground the way Rust compresses a refinery. Everything is
 * generated here; nothing is loaded from disk.
 *
 *   THE AXIS       the whole map is one north-south spine. The house owns the
 *                  north end of it, the loggia the south, and between them a
 *                  raised stone terrace carries the spa and the lap pool. It
 *                  is the map's longest sightline and its most exposed ground.
 *   THE HOUSE      centre-north. Two enterable storeys, a real staircase, and
 *                  a first floor whose south windows look down the entire
 *                  length of the pool — the overwatch everything else answers.
 *   THE POOL HOUSE east of the terrace: a long flat-roofed building with a
 *                  colonnade on the water and an outside stair to a walkable
 *                  roof. The map's second storey, and the counter to the house.
 *   THE GARDEN     north-east, behind a 1.15 m brick wall: raised beds at
 *                  crouch height, gravel paths between them, a potting shed in
 *                  the corner. Cover you fight *inside*, not around.
 *   THE COURT      west, screened by spruce. Wide open acrylic with one way in.
 *   THE FORECOURT  west of the house: gravel, a planted island, the carriage
 *                  house on its north side and the drive gate behind it.
 *
 * LOW POLY IS THE BRIEF, same as Rust, Wilmot and the Loop: chunky massing,
 * chamfered boxes and capped tubes, with all surface detail carried by the
 * shared procedural materials.
 *
 * AND PERFORMANCE IS THE TIE-BREAKER — this map spends less than Wilmot does
 * on the same acreage, on purpose, and the three decisions that buy it are:
 *
 *   1. THE GROUND IS FLAT INSIDE THE BOUNDARY. Wilmot digs a sunken garden and
 *      a pool basin into its height field, which is what forces its terrain to
 *      96 x 96 quads. Here the pool sits inside a RAISED terrace instead, so
 *      the basin is built geometry that was going to exist anyway and the lawn
 *      needs no resolution at all: 60 x 60 quads carries the whole estate.
 *   2. THE EVERGREENS ARE OPAQUE. Every green volume on Wilmot is a pair — a
 *      solid core plus an alpha-cut leaf shell. The ~150 conifers here are one
 *      opaque prototype each (see `fisherprops.js`), which is half the draw
 *      calls and none of the overdraw.
 *   3. THE GARDEN LIBRARY IS BORROWED, not rebuilt. `wilmotprops.js` already
 *      owns hedges, oaks, topiary, urns, benches and loungers; this map
 *      registers them and adds three prototypes of its own.
 *
 * LAYOUT NOTES
 *   Authored in LEVEL space, north at -Z, the house at the north end of the
 *   axis with its entrance front facing west onto the forecourt and its garden
 *   front facing south down the pool. The vertical routes are stairs only, as
 *   everywhere else in the game: the house's internal stair, and the outside
 *   flight up to the pool house roof. The pool is wadeable — its floor collider
 *   sits 0.58 m under the coping and a step at each end walks back out, so
 *   falling in is a detour, never a trap.
